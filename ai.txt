I used ChatGPT to understand importing the API keys.
Prompt: how do i add api keys without sharing what they are
Modifications: I was told to create .env and make sure that it was in my gitignore (it already was) and load them with load_dotenv()

I used ChatGPT to check my starting code.
Prompt: does this work def get_weather(city):
    url = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={OPENWEATHER_API}&units=imperial"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
        return None
    return response.json()
Modifications: I did not change anything as it worked but I did get suggestions on what I could change

I used ChatGPT for help with get_movies.
Prompt: how can i get random movies that are released in a specific year based on searching up keywords on omdb
Modifications: I was told to make a loop to get random movies and add an attempt option to make sure it is not calling the api too many times.

I used ChatGPT to help debug my get_movies.
Prompt: why is this not working to add movies if response.status_code == 200: movies.append({})
Modifications: I learned that I can't used append here and need to check if the response is true and then do get

I used ChatGPT to find the movie with the closest score to the weather.

Modifications: I was told to use scored_movies.sort(key=lambda x: abs(x[0] - w_score)) to compare the scores and find the closest ones

I used ChatGPT to make a starter results page.
Prompt: for the results i want to have it so its in a list order (top to bottom) the movie poster on the left and then the title on the right (bigger) and then info underneath the title
Modifications: I adjusted the format to my liking and customized it more

I used ChatGPT to help me fix the missing movie posters:
Prompt: why is the movie poster not always displaying {% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
    <h2>Top Movie Recommendations for {{ city }}:</h2>
    <div>
        {% for movie in movies %}
            <div class="movie">
                <div class="poster">
                    <img src="{{ movie.Poster }}" alt="Poster" width="100">
                </div>

                    <div class="title">{{ movie.Title }} ({{ movie.Year }})</div>

            </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
    <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">Search again</a>
{% endblock %}
Modifications: I added a no poster png to show up if there was no poster for the movie.

I used ChatGPT to fix my movie posters (again).
Prompt: sometimes the poster still doesnt load...i know there is a poster bc the no poster shows up for the ones without a poster
Modifications: I added onerror so that it would default to the no poster image if there was trouble with the movie poster.

I used ChatGPT to doublecheck that my scoring works.
Prompt: is there a way to print out the movies, the scores, and the weather scores to see if it is working correctly. not on the webpage just like through the terminal or smth
Modifications: I used the code ChatGPT gave me to print out my results in the terminal but I deleted it after as I was just using it to doublecheck that everything worked correctly.
