# Final Project HCDE 310
Welcome to Movie Weather Match! This program allows users to input a city and get movie recommendations based on the weather at that location. Users also have the option of selecting the time period of the movies they get recommended if they so choose. In the end, they will get three movies recommended to them based on the temperature, weather conditions, and cloudiness.
